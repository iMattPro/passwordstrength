## Features
* Password field changes colors from red (weak) to green (strong) as the user types in a password.
* Password strength is also labeled as 'Very Weak', 'Weak', 'Good', 'Strong' or 'Very Strong'.
* Password strength is active for all password fields.
* Password strength is scored using one of the available algorithms:
    1. __Complexity__ is an unintelligent test that checks for complexity in a password by looking for a mix of characters, case, symbols, numbers and length. This is useful for encouraging hard to remember complex passwords, but can score easily cracked passwords like `P@s$w0rd` as Strong.
    2. __zxcvbn algorithm__ (used by DropBox) is an intelligent algorithm that calculates the guess-ability of a password by comparing it to a large dictionary of common words in multiple languages as well as looking for recognizable patterns like `P@s$w0rd`. This is a more robust strength checker that allows for user-friendly passwords that are easy to remember but still hard to guess. A Very Strong result represents a password that may take a computer years to centuries to guess.
* Multiple languages are supported. View the pre-installed [localizations](https://github.com/iMattPro/passwordstrength/tree/master/language).
* The zxcvbn algorithm also displays user feedback about the password with support for Brazilian, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Polish and Spanish.

Password Strength is intended to encourage your forum users to use strong passwords. It does not guarantee protection against password attacks, nor does it force your users to use strong passwords. The business of scoring password strength is a tricky and hotly debated subject, and you are encouraged to decide which of the strength test models included in this extension will work best for your forum.
